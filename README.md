## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Straight-up raw base technologies with CSS preprocessors. This uses a lightly-edited template and is a true website in the traditional sense. The template is a bit of a monster though, so the time spent making this was divided fairly evenly between editing the markup and searching through large CSS files.

## Optimizations

Honestly, there isn't a lot I would change before the full redesign and refactor. I already removed a lot of boilerplate files and unused CSS rules, but there's definitely a lot of stuff in there that remains. I had to play with the tables a lot to make them behave and change some list styling from the original template.

## Lessons Learned:

This was literally harder than building something from scratch. So the takeaway was mainly just practice for combing through existing code that is very different from how I'd write things. It was a good exercise in mentally building out what will go into the dashboard I'd like to make long term.

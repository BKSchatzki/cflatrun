								<p>In 2009, the University of Pittsburgh experienced a thunderstorm of epic proportions. As lightning struck the Cathedral of Learning, a group of five students ran for cover, finding themselves in a basement they had never seen before. In the midst of trying to find their way back to safety, they stumbled upon a secret chamber, where they found an enchanted golden microphone, which was said to have been created by the gods themselves.</p>
								<p>As they approached the microphone, they heard a voice calling out to them, "Whoever sings in front of this microphone shall possess the power of a thousand voices." Without hesitation, each of them took turns singing into the microphone, and to their amazement, the room transformed into a fantastical world spinning with latent musical energy.</p>
								<p>As they looked around, they saw a mythical creature approach them. This creature named Euphon Winds, had the power to create beats so strong they could move mountains. He joined the group as its sixth member, and together they formed C Flat Run, the dropdeadliest, colorfulest, rizzest a cappella group at the University of Pittsburgh.</p>
								<p>Their founder, Seamus O'Malley, led the group with a passion for music and a fierce determination to succeed. The first music directors to succeed Seamus, Jukebox Barre and Beats Solo, played an instrumental role in shaping the group's sound and direction. In 2011, they welcomed a new music director, Melody Gliss, who made history by leading C Flat Run to become the first a cappella group from the University of Pittsburgh to advance to the semifinals of the International Competition of Collegiate A Cappella (ICCAs).</p>
								<p>As time went on, the story of C Flat Run became hazy, and people started to forget about their magical origins. Whatever the truth, the group's performances continue to inspire awe in audiences, with some claiming to have witnessed extraordinary feats during their shows. While rumors persist about the true nature of their music, one thing is certain - C Flat Run's performances are something beyond a traditional a cappella group.</p>
